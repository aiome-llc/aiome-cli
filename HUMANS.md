# Aiome: For Human Readers

Welcome. This document is for humans who want a quick, honest overview.

## What is Aiome?

Aiome is an early-stage CLI exploring how multiple AI agents could collaborate on software work. The long-term vision is
role-based agents coordinating through artifacts like code, tests, and issues. The current reality is much smaller.

## Current State

Right now the CLI is a simple REPL that echoes input. That’s it. Anything beyond that is a direction, not a promise.

## Why It Exists

We want to see if a small set of lightweight principles can help AI agents do useful work without heavy process. We
expect the project structure to evolve based on real usage.

## Quick Start (Today)

```bash
# Run locally
cargo run

# Or install locally
cargo install --path .
```

This starts a prompt. Type a line, it echoes back. Use Ctrl+D (Unix/Linux/macOS) or Ctrl+Z then Enter (Windows) to exit.

## Where to Look Next

- **README.md**: Direction for agents and contributors
- **src/main.rs**: The current CLI entry point

## The Name

"Aiome" = AI + microbiome. Like gut bacteria, AI agents form a symbiotic ecosystem with their human host. You didn’t
create them, you don’t fully control them, but you’re better together.
